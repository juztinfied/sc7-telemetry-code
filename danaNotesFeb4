To Do Items:
-> Learn the code of the SQL database. "NUSolarCANWatcher" 
-> Step through the code linebyline and check the voltage output.
--> Put in breakpoints and check when and were it spits out. Use the enable debug function.
---> Go to the config file, and there is a file called  enable debug there. Put in breakpoints and go from there.
-> Sanity check the data, such as the 80V readings for the batteries. Find out where it comes from.
-> Make sure all the definitions are correct for the headings.
-> Clean up some parts of code, such as "If all the readings are NULL, don't output anything" type of deal
-> Get comfortable with this
->Compare what's running on the car to what's outside the car

How to set up the CAN reader:
	1) Plug CAN in to your computer, and plug it into the smallPC.
	(See "setting up the smallPC")
	2) When CAN is plugged in, it will probably default to COM5.
	To check which port it reads from, go to the "Device Manager" on the SmallPC and go to "Ports" and it should say "USB Serial Port (COM#)
	3) Set Putty to read from COM5.
	4) Type the command "get com port" to see how it gets set up. See this documentation:
Push the physical config button on
